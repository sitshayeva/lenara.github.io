  # Project 1: Explore a Dataset on Energy Usage and Draw First Conclusions
  
  AusEnergy, a supplier of domestic and industrial energy in Australia. The company has approached DataSpace for assistance. They are concerned about their ability to efficiently manage the supply of electricity as the demand can vary greatly from day to day.
  AusEnergy has supplied us with some data regarding energy demand in Australia over a few years. They want us to show that we can interpret their existing data.
  The big concern this client has is that they need to manage the supply of energy efficiently.
We need to help them answer three key questions:
* What does demand look like over time?
* What does extreme demand look like, and under what circumstances does this happen?
* How do factors like the weather and holidays affect demand?

All of your work performed in a spreadsheet program such as MS Excel.
